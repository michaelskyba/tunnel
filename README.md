# tunnel
Tunnel is a simple SM-2 implementation. It's a Go rewrite of
[scripture](https://github.com/michaelskyba/scripture), a similar project I
wrote in Shell. My goal is for tunnel to be faster than scripture and to follow 
the UNIX philosophy better. Being written in Go should bring other benefits,
such as a cleaner, more maintainable codebase and an automated test system
(without an added dependency).
